#The disadvantage of using procedural programming in C is it does 
#not make good use of the same methods. Some transportation means share
#the same methods. Adding another way would be easier when taking advantage
#of the existing methods.

#The strength of using procedural programming is that the methods are designed 
#specifically for that mean of transportation. People will have a better understanding 
#of the procedures for the programs.
